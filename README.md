# windows-explorer-open-file-background-location
Windows Registry files for adding Explorer context-menu options for opening new Explorer windows at either a file's location or by using the Explorer window background, such as in a File->Open or File->Save dialogs that do not allow the user to select the path.

For example, in a File->Open or File->Save dialog where the user cannot select the path, after loading these registry entries, you will be able to right-click on the dialog background, and select **Open this folder in new window**, which will open a new Explorer window at that location.

Similarly, you can right-click on a file, and select **Open file location in new window**, which will open a new Explorer window at the selected file's location.

It is pretty simple, actually. I was annoyed by File->Open/File->Save and other similar dialogs that do not allow the user to select the path. This happens when I am saving files to a location, and the program that I'm using remembers the location, but won't let me copy the path. Problem solved!

Files are included for adding and removing the registry entries.
